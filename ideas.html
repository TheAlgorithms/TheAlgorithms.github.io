                <p>
                    <b>Detailed Description: </b> We have a lot of algorithms in 20+ programming languages in our GitHub
                    repositories, but they are not properly organised and discoverability is not good. For a beginner,
                    it becomes difficult to learn algorithms and their implementation. For a person who is not familiar
                    with Git or Github, this can become a hurdle in learning.
                    So we want to build an interactive web app where students can explore various algorithms and learn
                    their implementation in the programming language of their choice. The code for these algorithms and
                    their plain text explanation should be fetched automatically from Github Repos and rendered in a
                    readable form. Further, this plain text explanation can also be multilingual.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>Detailed Description: </b> Currently, if you want to apply for a job, you visit the career page
                    of the job. Then, you fill the form with the same details you have filled for other jobs that you
                    have applied for. Sometimes, Google Chrome helps fill the form by autofill data, but this is not
                    always possible. The forms may ask your Twitter/LinkedIn profile URL and Google Chrome doesn’t save
                    this. In this situation, you visit the desired social page, copy the URL and then paste it on the
                    form. The same happens when skills and experience are filed in the application. In this project, we
                    are trying to make a browser extension that is capable of saving everything and auto-fills the job
                    form or any type of form effectively.

                    tool focuses only on Python submissions but TheAlgorithms currently has repositories for 25
                    programming languages. Work should be done to make useful initial code reviews across multiple
                    programming languages. Automated reviews should be intuitive and self-documenting and should always
                    encourage contributions.
